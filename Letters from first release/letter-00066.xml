                            >This letter was written in response to a denunciation sent from Moscow
                            by Archpriest <ref target="people.xml#ale03">Petr Alekseev</ref> to
                            Khrapovitsky on 3 September 1789. Alekseev claimed that Platon,
                            Metropolitan of Moscow, was showing people Voltaire's correspondence
                            with Catherine, which risked casting doubt on Catherine's Orthodoxy
                            because she corresponded with an 'atheist'. Alekseev alleged Platon
                            might even have it translated into Russian, which would be dangerous
                            because more 'Русские безразсудные читатели' ('thoughtless Russian
                            readers') would come to such conclusions. K.A. Papmehl reads Catherine's
                            response as showing that the denunciation 'stirred her ire against
                            Platon to an unprecedented degree', citing as evidence Alekseev's next
                            letter to Khrapovitsky, in which he promised '"to carry out the tasks I
                            am entrusted with in a suitable manner, using the Prelate's favourites
                            who are also my friends"'. Papmehl adds that in the <ref
                                target="letter-00075.xml">letter</ref> to commander-in-chief of
                            Moscow, Eropkin, sent a week later, 'Catherine thus baited a trap for
                            Platon', in asking none other than the Metropolitan himself to censor
                            the complete works of Voltaire, published by Beaumarchais (<bibl><title
                                    ref="works.xml#metrop01">Metropolitan Platon of Moscow</title>,
                                    <biblScope unit="pp">pp. 51-52</biblScope></bibl>). It is true
                            also that Alekseev continued to provide denunciations, especially
                            against Freemasons, in coming years. One might venture, however, a
                            different reading of the present episode. If already in 1789 Catherine
                            already detested the Metropolitan as much as is claimed, it would seem
                            strange that in the coming years Platon continued to correspond with
                            Grigory Potemkin, while the new commander-in-chief of Moscow, A.A.
                            Prozorovsky, trusted him to appoint censors for Nikolay Novikov's
                            archive. Moreover, when, in 1792, Catherine finally yielded to Platon's
                            repeated requests to retire, she kept him in his official post, while
                            giving his duties to a subordinate. Platon may have complained, but one
                            can only imagine that Catherine kept him on for so long because she
                            still found Platon useful and effective. If she had really been angry
                            with him, she could surely have removed him earlier and/or less
                            honorably. (See <bibl><author>Papmehl</author>, <title
                                    ref="works.xml#metrop01">Metropolitan Platon</title>, <biblScope
                                    unit="pp">pp. 54-55</biblScope></bibl>.) In this particular case
                            of Voltaire's correspondence, Catherine must have known that Platon
                            would be condemning himself by casting doubt on her Orthodoxy via the
                            letters to Voltaire: after all, Platon himself received enthusiastic
                            support from Voltaire, who praised his sermon on the victory at Chesme
                            as worthy of the philosopher Plato. Accordingly, it is tempting to
                            suggest that Catherine might have even perceived the twisted heart of
                            Alekseev and guessed that he was the one responsible for the misguided
                            interpretation of the Voltaire letters. Alekseev, a noted denunciator
                            and man of continual bad faith, wanted to puff himself up by claiming
                            that Khrapovitsky's relation of the contents of Catherine's note was in
                            fact a special mission against Platon. (For further related materials,

                    <p>You can answer the holy man that there was no one from whom a munificent hand
                        could have less expected a rash interpretation of the said correspondence
                        than from a holy individual, who has been showered with and distinguished
                        and elevated by generosity and bounties. Only a heart filled with malice
                        could take it amiss. For, the correspondence was in itself most innocent and
                        took place at a time when that eighty-year-old man was trying, in writings
                        that were avidly read all over Europe, to glorify Russia, to abase her
                        enemies, and to restrain the active enmity of his compatriots, who were then
                        attempting to spread biting malice against the affairs of our Fatherland. In
                        this he succeeded. Letters written to an atheist with this intent and
                        purpose, it would seem, caused no harm either to the Church or to the
                        Fatherland.</p>
