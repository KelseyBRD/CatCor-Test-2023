                            >According to K.A. Papmehl, in this letter Catherine was setting a
                            'trap' for Platon, metropolitan of Moscow, who had been denounced by
                            Petr Alekseev as using Catherine's correspondence with Voltaire as a way
                            of discrediting her Orthodoxy (see Catherine's <ref
                                target="letter-00066.xml">letter to Khrapovitsky of 17 September
                                1789</ref> and the editorial note on it). Papmehl does not mention
                            that there really was a <ref target="works.xml#pol01">large-scale effort
                                to translate Voltaire</ref>, if not from the Beaumarchais edition,
                            being undertaking in Moscow at that time: Catherine may really have
                            heard about it. One might also think that, seeing the manifest absurdity
                            of Alekseev's accusation, Catherine in the present letter reasserted her
                            trust in Platon and her continued desire to use him in her service. One
                            might imagine that she knew that Alekseev would interpret her letter as
                            giving him free rein to attack Platon, and she thus indirectly
                            reestablished the Metropolitan's authority. Rather than proving a
                            two-faced and malicious enemy of Platon, she perhaps used the two
                            letters in question to cleverly balance the two rival clergymen and to
                            ensure that she could continue to use Platon as an unfanatical clergyman
                            and censor, as well as Alekseev as a source of information. It is worth
                            noting that while Catherine was not pleased about the publication of her
                            letters by Beaumarchais and was already concerned about the French
                            Revolution, she also at this time did not regard Voltaire as an enemy:
                            her letters to Grimm show her reading Voltaire's <ref
                                target="works.xml#hen01">Henriade</ref> and citing Voltaire as a
                            royalist still a year later in 1790. It is rather amusing, though, that
                            she remembered only 69 volumes of the Kehl edition: it was in fact 70
                            volumes. She must have wanted (consciously or unconsciously) to exclude
                            the volume containing her correspondence from the full extent of
                            Beaumarchais's edition.</note></p>

                    <p>Since rumours have reached us that in Moscow there are plans to translate
                        Beaumarchais's new edition of all the works of Voltaire in 69 volumes, order
                        the Police Board and the senior police constable to ensure that such an
                        edition is by no means printed on any press without the censorship and
                        approval of the Right Reverend Metropolitan of Moscow.</p>
